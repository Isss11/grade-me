# grade-me

A simple C++ GPA analyzer that I implemented to learn the basics of C++.

## Set-up

Please ensure that you have the g++ compiler installed.

To compile, please run:

`make`

Then place a CSV file that complies with the program's specified file format in the data folder, such as `marks.csv`.

To run, please enter:

`./bin/gpa ./data/marks.csv`
